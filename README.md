# 📊 Market Sentiment vs Trader Behavior Analysis

## Overview

This project analyzes the relationship between **market sentiment (Fear/Greed)** and **trader behavior and performance** using historical trading data. The goal is to uncover behavioral patterns, identify profitable sentiment transitions, and evaluate how emotional states like "Fear" and "Greed" influence trading outcomes.

## 📁 Files Included

- `Full_Market_Sentiment_Report.pdf` – Complete report with visualizations and final insights
- `notebook.ipynb` *(optional)* – Jupyter notebook with all data preprocessing and analysis steps
- `README.md` – This file

## 📌 Key Insights

- **Sentiments persist**: "Fear" and "Greed" often last for multiple consecutive days (behavioral streaks).
- **Greed favors profits**: Trades made during "Greed" phases tend to yield higher average PnL than those made during "Fear".
- **Transitions matter**: Some transitions (e.g., *Fear → Greed*) show consistent profitability, revealing predictive potential.
- **Streak analysis**: Longer "Greed" streaks often result in higher profits, while "Fear" streaks show steady underperformance.
- **Volume spikes during Fear**: Trade activity increases significantly in fearful markets — possibly due to panic reactions.

## 📈 Visualizations

The analysis includes:
- Trade volume by sentiment
- Average PnL by sentiment
- Sentiment transition heatmap with PnL
- Sentiment streak vs. average PnL trend
- Timeline of sentiment over trading days
- Final dashboard summarizing all patterns

## 🧠 Conclusion

Understanding the “addictiveness” and behavioral cycles of market sentiment can offer traders a **strategic edge**. This report demonstrates how combining data science with emotional intelligence can support **smarter, sentiment-aware trading in the Web3 space.**
